 This is a helper class that shows webpages. These come down in several forms - sometimes a CloudPage, sometimes something from OpenDirect - and this guy shows them. It's a pretty simple class that pops up a view with a toolbar, shows a webpage, and waits to be dismissed.
 
 This class encapuslates a WKWebView.
