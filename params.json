It is also a UI for exploring its features and provides a mechanism to collect and send debugging information to learn about the workings of the SDK as you explore.\r\n\r\nThe code in this repository includes all of the code used to run the fully functional APK including an App ID and Access Token to let you test and debug the application. These keys will trigger an hourly automated push message of a timestamp, indicating that the application is properly setup. To create a new app the following keys must be set with your own values within the corresponding file.\r\n\r\n**AppDelegate+ETPushConstants.m**\r\n\r\n1. `kETAppID_Prod`: the App ID for your development app as defined in the App Center section of the Marketing Cloud.\r\n\r\n2. `kETAccessToken_Prod`: the Access Token for your development app as defined in the App Center section of the Marketing Cloud.\r\n\r\nNB: You can use different keys for the staging/testing phase and the production phase.  Staging/testing keys are called `kETAppID_Debug` and `kETAccessToken_Debug`.\r\n<a name=\"0002\"></a>\r\n## Marketing Cloud App Center\r\n\r\nApp Center is the central development console for using Fuel’s APIs and building Marketing Cloud apps.\r\n\r\nIn order to connect your app to the Marketing Cloud, you must first create a MobilePush app in the App Center. \r\n\r\nEach app in App Center represents an application connected to the Marketing Cloud. App Center currently manages four types of connected apps:\r\n\r\n* *API Integration* allows you to leverage the Marketing Cloud APIs. Create an API Integration app when you want to use Fuel APIs to automate tasks or integrate business systems. API Integration apps utilize an OAuth2 client credentials flow to acquire access tokens directly from the Fuel authentication service.\r\n\r\n* *Marketing Cloud apps* represent apps that live within the Salesforce Marketing Cloud and launch via the Marketing Cloud app menu. Marketing Cloud apps include custom apps built by your organization or apps installed from the Salesforce Marketing Cloud HubExchange. Marketing Cloud apps utilize a JSON Web Token (JWT) to acquire access tokens on behalf of logged in users.\r\n\r\n* *Application Extensions* allow you to extend the Marketing Cloud with custom Journey Builder activities, Cloud Editor Blocks, and Automation Studio activities.\r\n\r\n* *MobilePush apps* represent apps built for the iOS, Android, or Blackberry mobile platforms that use MobilePush to communicate with their users via push messages. The Salesforce Marketing Cloud classifies MobilePush apps as consumer-grade applications and utilize long-lived limited access tokens.\r\n\r\nIf you haven’t already, you should [create an App Center account](https://appcenter-auth.exacttargetapps.com/create).\r\n\r\nIf you have an App Center account, you can [log in to that account](https://appcenter-auth.exacttargetapps.com/redirect).\r\n<a name=\"0003\"></a>\r\n## Push Notifications\r\n\r\nMobilePush lets you create and send targeted push messages based on cross-channel consumer data to encourage app usage and deliver increased ROI.  With MobilePush, you view how users navigate through your app and because MobilePush is built on the Salesforce Marketing Cloud, you can easily integrate push message campaigns with any email, SMS, or social campaigns.\r\n<a name=\"0004\"></a>\r\n## Subscriber key\r\n\r\nA subscriber is a person who has opted to receive communications from your organization. \r\n\r\nA valid email address is required to receive emails and a phone number to receive SMS messages.  Additional information about subscribers can be tracked using profile and preference attributes.\r\n\r\nThe Subscriber Key serves to identify your subscribers.\r\n\r\nIt can be set to a specific value provided by the subscriber such as a phone number, email address, or other appropriate value but most importantly a value that you choose.\r\n\r\nFor example, using a subscriber key to identify a subscriber with a value other than the email address would allow you to:\r\n\r\n* Maintain multiple sets of subscriber attributes for a single email address. For example, if a family shares an email address, you can use a subscriber key to uniquely identify each member of the family.\r\n\r\n* Include a single email address multiple times on a list. For example, if a message interaction sends a separate message for each car a subscriber owns, it may be appropriate for a single subscriber to receive multiple messages.\r\n\r\nThe Salesforce Marketing Cloud interface as well as the Web Service SOAP API support functionality around subscribers identified with a subscriber key.\r\n<a name=\"0005\"></a>\r\n## Tags\r\n\r\nTags let you implement contact segmentation. You can set tags for subscriptions as defined by user choice.  Additionally, use tags to collect information from the mobile app and for unstructured data or data that can contain many potential unknown values. For example, you can use tags when the number of potential attribute names exceeds the number of potential values of an individual attribute (such as the favorite brand specified by a contact).\r\n<a name=\"0006\"></a>\r\n## Beacon and Geofence Messages\r\n\r\nYou can use the location capabilities of the *JB4A SDK* to target messages to a segmented group of contacts.  Send personalized messages to increase engagement. The app pre-downloads geofence messages and triggers those messages when a mobile device crosses a geofence boundary.  To use this functionality:\r\n\r\n1. The account must have access to both MobilePush and Location Services.\r\n\r\n2. Ensure that you use version 7.8.0 or earlier of Google Play Services to enable geolocation for your app.\r\n\r\n3. You must receive user permission to implement location services.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"0006b\"></a>\r\n## Analytics\r\n\r\nMobile Application Analytics enables marketers to gather mobile app actions and behaviors from users and provides powerful visualizations of the data. The data helps you make informative decisions about how to structure your customer journeys, design your client facing experiences and tailor your digital marketing campaigns. The collected data is also available inside the Salesforce Marketing Cloud – ready to be used to segment messaging lists, provide highly personalized messaging content and drive 1:1  Custom Journeys.\r\n\r\nAfter enabling the analytics feature in your app, visit the Web & Mobile Analytics application within the Marketing Cloud.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"0017\"></a>\r\n# Implementation on iOS\r\n\r\n<a name=\"0018\"></a>\r\n## Previous steps\r\n\r\n1. iOS Provisioning Panel\r\n\r\n2. Create your apps in the App Center\r\n\r\n<a name=\"0019\"></a>\r\n### iOS Provisioning Panel\r\n\r\nYou must provision your mobile app in the iOS Provisioning Panel.
